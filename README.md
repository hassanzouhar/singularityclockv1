# Singularity Clock Project

Welcome to the Singularity Clock project. This initiative aims to create a prediction engine for humanity by analyzing the impact of artificial intelligence on society. Inspired by the "Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists", our goal is to provide real-time insights into how AI affects different aspects of life.

## Overview

The Singularity Clock website serves as a platform to:
- Understand the co-evolution of humans and AI.
- Build a comprehensive platform to track and predict the outcomes of AI introduction in society.
- Provide real-time insights based on data analysis and predictive models.

## Features

### Dynamic Clock Display
The website features a clock that updates every second. The clock is initially set to display the time "22:44:30" and will update every second until it reaches "22:45:00", at which point a glitch effect is applied to the last digit.

### Information Sections
Several sections provide insights into the purpose and methods of the project:
- **Understanding Human and AI Co-Evolution**: Explains the goal of tracking and predicting AI's impact using various data sources and models.
- **How Do We Gain Insight?**: Describes the methodologies such as crowdsourcing feedback, predictive modeling, monitoring employment trends, tracking consumer trends, and using economic indicators.

### Subscription Form
Users can join the project by submitting their name and email through a subscription form. This allows them to stay updated and contribute to the project's goals.

### Responsive Design
The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring accessibility and a visually appealing experience across various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the webpage to make it visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the dynamic clock and glitch effect.

## How It Works

1. **Clock Initialization**: The JavaScript code initializes the clock to "22:44:30" and updates it every second.
2. **Glitch Effect**: When the clock reaches "22:45:00", a glitch effect is applied to the last digit.
3. **Information Display**: Various sections explain the project's purpose and methodologies.
4. **Subscription**: A form collects user information for project updates.
